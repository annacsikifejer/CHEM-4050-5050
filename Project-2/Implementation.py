Implement an MD simulation of a polymer chain using the bead-spring model.

Include harmonic bond potentials and Lennard-Jones non-bonded interactions.

Simulate the polymer at different temperatures.

Calculate and analyze properties such as radius of gyration, end-to-end distance, and potential energy.

Observe and characterize the phase transition between folded and unfolded states.
