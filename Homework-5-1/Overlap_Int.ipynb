    "print(\"As the separation distance increases, the overlap integral decreases in what appears to be an exponential decay rate approaching zero. This is physically reasonable, as an increase in the separation distance between two hydrogen 2pz orbitals indicates that the orbitals are located further apart, and therefore have less overlap in the areas of their orbitals. The decay of the relationship is also significant, since it signifies that a large portion of the overlap of the 2pz orbitals is contained very close to the center, as an increase in separation distance beyond 10 Angstroms has signficantly less impact in the overlap integral compared to distances below 10 Angstroms.\")"
