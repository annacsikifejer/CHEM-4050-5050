### The following observations can be made regarding the trends of the second virial coefficient vs temperature for the Hard-Sphere, Square-Well, and Lennard-Jones potentials:

#### - The Hard-Sphere potential remains relatively constant with a second virial coefficient of approximately 50 cm^3 / mol, which the Square-Well and Lennard-Jones potentials see a positive trend that resembles a natural log relationship
#### - At temperatures under approximately 200 K the Lennard-Jones potential has a less negative second virial coefficient compared to the Square-Well coefficient, while for temperatures above 200 K, the Square-Well potential has a less negative second virial coefficient
#### - The Square-Well and Lennard-Jones potentials both show a negative second virial coefficient until temperatures of approximately 350 K and 390 K respectively


### From these observations, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the different potentials' account of deviations from ideal gas behavior:

#### - The Hard-Sphere potential model has little to no dependence on the temperature, and shows a greater contribution of repulsive forces between atoms, likely due to a higher assumed particle size than the other models
#### - The Square-Well potential model and Lennard-Jones Model both show a greater contribution of attractive forces between atoms at low temperatures, likely due to a smaller assumed particle size and decreased kinetic energy of atoms
#### - The rate of change in the Lennard-Jones potential appears to be higher than that of the Square-Well potential model, indicating a model that is more sensitive to the provided variables
